1. 

2.  **Biometric Authentication System:**
    - Build a biometric authentication system using signal processing techniques on fingerprint or iris data. Explore methods like Fourier analysis for feature extraction.

3.  **Digital Watermarking:**
    - Implement a digital watermarking algorithm to embed information in images or audio signals without perceptible degradation. Evaluate the robustness and invisibility of the watermark.

4.  **Digital Radio Receiver:**
    - Design a simple digital radio receiver that can tune in to different frequencies and decode radio signals. Explore modulation and demodulation techniques.

5.  **Voice Activity Detection (VAD):**
    - Develop a VAD system that can distinguish between speech and non-speech segments in an audio signal. This is useful in various applications, including speech processing and telecommunications.

6.  **Dynamic Range Compression for Audio:**
    - Implement a dynamic range compression algorithm to automatically adjust the loudness of audio signals. Analyze the impact on perceived audio quality.

7.  **Music Genre Classification:**
    - Build a system that classifies music genres based on audio features. Use machine learning techniques in conjunction with signal processing for accurate classification.

8.  **Real-time Signal Processing on Arduino/Raspberry Pi:**
    - Implement a real-time signal processing application on a low-cost microcontroller platform like Arduino or Raspberry Pi. This could be an audio processing or image processing project.

9.  **Channel Equalization in Communication Systems:**
    - Develop a channel equalization algorithm to compensate for distortion and interference in communication channels. Evaluate the performance under different channel conditions.

10. **Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitoring:**
    - Investigate the feasibility of non-invasive blood glucose monitoring using signal processing techniques. Explore the correlation between physiological signals and blood glucose levels.

11. **Pulse Oximetry Signal Processing:**
    - Work on processing pulse oximetry signals to extract heart rate and oxygen saturation information. Analyze the challenges and techniques involved in accurate signal processing.

12. **Gesture-Controlled Robotic Arm:**
    - Implement a gesture-controlled robotic arm using sensors (like accelerometers or gyroscopes) to capture gestures. Process the signals to control the movements of the robotic arm.
