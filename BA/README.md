# PDS-3rd-year


1. **Audio Equalizer:**
   - Implement a real-time audio equalizer that allows users to adjust the frequency bands to enhance or attenuate specific frequencies in audio signals.

2. **Speech Recognition System:**
   - Develop a simple speech recognition system using techniques like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for basic command recognition.

3. **Image Compression:**
   - Implement a basic image compression algorithm, such as JPEG or Wavelet-based compression, and analyze the trade-offs between compression ratio and image quality.

4. **Heart Rate Monitoring and Filtering:**
   - Design a system that reads a heart rate signal and filters out noise using digital signal processing techniques. Visualize the heart rate over time.

5. **FIR/IIR Filter Design:**
   - Have students design and implement Finite Impulse Response (FIR) or Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters for different specifications. They can compare the performance of these filters in terms of frequency response and phase characteristics.

6. **Digital Audio Effects:**
   - Implement digital audio effects such as reverb, chorus, or flanger. Allow users to apply these effects to audio signals and analyze the impact.

7. **Biomedical Signal Processing:**
   - Work on processing biomedical signals like ECG or EEG. Implement filtering, feature extraction, and analysis techniques to identify patterns or anomalies in the signals.

8. **Adaptive Noise Cancellation:**
   - Develop a system that uses adaptive filters to cancel noise from a corrupted signal, such as removing noise from an audio recording or a biomedical signal.
